        So, what does that mean? Well, considering the following facts:
        <br></br>1. Our bodies use energy to do things. <br></br>2. Energy
        cannot be created or destroyed; only transferred That means if Billy
        consumes a pizza of 3,000 calories, but only uses 2,000 calories, the
        excess 1,000 doesn't just disappear. Rather, our bodies store it for
        later use for survivability purposes. Our bodies store excess energy as
        fat, and fat has weight. Alternatively, if Billy consumes a pizza of
        2,000 calories, but uses 3,000 calories, the 1,000 doesn't just appear.
        Billy will get the energy from breaking down part of his own body,
        usually fat, which mean that fat gets used up or “burned” away for
        energy.
