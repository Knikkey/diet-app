        This is always a tough one, and sadly there aren't many good answers.
        However, here are some suggestions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Back/front load your calorie intake for the day depending on when
          you're planning to meet your friends. Meeting them for dinner? Keep
          your calorie intake extra low throughout the day until dinner. Meeting
          for breakfast? Do the opposite.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your calorie intake down throughout the week to "save" calories
          for your friends. If you're meeting your friends on Saturday, go 100 -
          200 calories deeper into your deficit from Sunday - Friday. Then on
          Saturday, you'll have 600 - 1200 "extra" calories saved for your
          friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do your best to opt for the lower calorie menu items when out with
          your friends.
        </li>
        <li>
          Invite your friends out to activities that aren't food related, such
          as bowling or a movie.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
